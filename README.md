Using WebGL Templates
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-templates.html

Custom templates are added to a project by creating a folder called “WebGLTemplates” in the Assets folder - the templates themselves are sub-folders within this folder. Each template folder contains an index.html file along with any other resources the page needs, such as images or stylesheets.
