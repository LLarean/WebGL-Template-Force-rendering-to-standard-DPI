# WebGL-Template-Force-rendering-to-standard-DPI-

The current page template now has a configuration field for devicePixelRatio. If you want to render to standard DPI, you can use the template.

Custom templates are added to a project by creating a folder called “WebGLTemplates” in the Assets folder - the templates themselves are sub-folders within this folder. Each template folder contains an index.html file along with any other resources the page needs, such as images or stylesheets.
